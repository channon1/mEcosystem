#mEcosystem

Did you know that you can  grow food out of an aquarium? Well you can, using the science of Aquaponics, we at mEcosystem design systems that connect you to your food.

Aquaponics uses fish waste as plant fertilizer and plants as a water filter. The fish grow the plants and the plants keep the fish tank clean.

Through a symbiotic relationship, we allow users to enjoy the traditional aspects of aquaculture and keeping fish with the added benefit of four to six square feet for growing plants making the food experience more personal.

We design both twenty and thirty gallon models as well as custom systems to suit your needs. All mEcosystems are powered by Arduino technology that allows you to customize your system's electronics and monitor the conditions of the fish and plants right from your computer, tablet, or phone.
